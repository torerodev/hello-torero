## Summary
To make your first [torero](https://torero.dev) experience as easy as possible, let's start by saying **hello** to the **world**! Today, torero supports Ansible, Python, and OpenTOFU. This _repository_ contains the code and instructions for importing and running each _hello world_ example into a fresh install of torero as individual services.

## Before you get started
Follow the instructions at [https://docs.torero.dev/en/latest/installation/#pre-requisites](https://docs.torero.dev/en/latest/installation/#pre-requisites) to install torero if you haven't already. Installation is a breeze -- torero is distributed as a single binary and can be installed on Mac OS or any Debian + RHEL based distro in seconds.
